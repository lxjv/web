	<header>laker's social media greeting - <a href="/">back home</a></header>

	<p>
	hey, i'm <a href="/">laker</a>. this is how i accept follow requests etc. on the fediverse and social media in general (if i use it)
	</p>

	<div class="box orange">
		<h2 style="font-style: italic;">laker.gay follow requests</h2>
		<p>
			i only accept follow requests from people i can reasonably trust, essencially don't show yourself to be a complete dickhead and ill accept you as long as you also have a profile picture, bio etc.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 8px;">being openly LGBT also helps as i can relate to you a little easier (dont take it personal cishets, thanx)</p>
	</div>

	<div class="box blue">
		<h2 style="font-style: italic;">boundaries</h2>
		<p>
		anyone with a no minors / 18+ rule on their account, don't bother following.
		i will just soft-block you as i am 17. in general, take that as you wish.
		</p>
		<p style="padding-top: 8px;">
		i don't mind jokes at my expense, i'll probably find them funny.
		please don't respond on my behalf about them, as it just causes a mess that i dont have the energy to clean up.
		</p>
	</div>

	<p>anyway, have a nice day :)</p>
