        <b class="box" style="background-color: rgba(117, 72, 108, 0.26); max-width: fit-content;">
            TLDR: fast, accessible, simple.
        </b>

        <p>
           This website is perfect. Why?
           Everyone* can read it, it's fast, and it's simple as fuck. <br>
           Also, I don't know HOW to do the shit that would make it anything but that. <br>
           And I am completely okay with that, as I dont CARE about knowing that. <br> <br>

           If you disagree with me, aight. I dont give a toss. <br>
